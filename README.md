# AI-Powered Exit Poll Prediction System

Welcome to the **AI-Powered Exit Poll Prediction System** project! This project aims to utilize advanced machine learning and data analytics techniques to predict election outcomes based on exit poll data. Our goal is to provide accurate, real-time forecasts that can be used by media organizations, political analysts, and the general public.

## Key Features

- **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** Automated collection and preprocessing of exit poll data from various sources.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implementations of regression, classification, and ensemble methods for election outcome prediction.
- **Real-time Prediction:** Continuous updating of predictions with new exit poll data.
- **Visualization:** Interactive charts and graphs for visualizing predictions and trends.
- **User Interface:** Web-based interface for easy access to predictions, historical data, and analysis tools.

Since this is the initial commit, we have not yet developed the system. Stay tuned for updates and follow the instructions below to set up the project once we begin development.
